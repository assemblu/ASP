## Cleaning up the mess
So, we both can agree that this repository is a mess at this point. However, I am putting in the effort to clean this up and demonstrate my knowledge step by step. This way I also happen to open-source the algorithms I write. If you desire to follow everything in order please notice the README files in each directory and sub directory. They are there to provide you with directives as to how to navigate this current mess until it's resolved.
