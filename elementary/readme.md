A linear progression of what I know, just doing some weekend and sometimes evening getaways from the corporate shackles.
<br>
Linearly you may check the following paths:<br>
- Time Series Denoise                               /time
- Spectral Analysis                                 /spectral
- Filtering                                         /filtering
- Convolution                                       /convolution
- Wavelet Analysis                                  /wavelets
- Resampling, Interpolating, and Extrapolating      /RIE

Above is my planned curriculim with more to be added over time.
